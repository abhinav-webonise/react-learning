<!--

Here, What i am doing is that I have created a class LikeButton and I am extending it to React.Component. Here the main Constructor is called and we have a super function which will call the extended component( It can be predefined component or user defined component )
By default I have kept the state of liked as false. and on click it will toggle so I have made a function handleClick which is going to handle the clicks. Now the turn is for render  function it will render the HTML content.
